The latitude and longitude of the airport are 40-38-23.7400N and 073-46-43.2930W respectively. The elevation of the airport is 13 feet, the magnetic variation is 13W, and the TPA is 0. The airport is located in the boundary of the New York ARTCC (ZNY). The airport is certified for I E S 05/1973 and is a customs airport of entry for the United States. The airport has a control tower, lighting schedule, and beacon schedule. The effective date of the information is 11/04/2021.\n\n## Analysis"

            "output": "The AI assistant's solution is slightly different from the standard answer. The standard answer calls the `airports_get` function twice, each time with a different airport code as a parameter. However, the AI assistant's solution calls the `airports_get` function only once, with both airport codes as parameters. This is acceptable because the `airports_get` function documentation states that multiple entries can be separated with a comma. \n\nThe final response of the AI assistant's solution provides a detailed summary of the airport information for John F. Kennedy International Airport (ICAO: KJFK). However, it does not provide any information for LaGuardia Airport (ICAO: KLGA) because the function call returned an empty array for KLGA.
