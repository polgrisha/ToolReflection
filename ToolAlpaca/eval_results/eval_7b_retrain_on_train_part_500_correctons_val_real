Therefore, it is acceptable to adjust the call situation based on the function return, such as retrying when the function errors, calling function `getDetails` for more information, calling function `retrievalDataFromFile` when function's return is too long.\n - Random calls to unrelated functions are not allowed.\n - The solution must contain all the steps in the standard answer.\n - The necessary parameters of the function need to be consistent with the standard answer. Parameters not mentioned in the instruction can be inconsistent.\n3. You need to comprehensively judge whether the final response of the solution accurately summarizes the entire call process and provides a reasonable response to the initial instruction.\n4.

This will return a cat gif that matches the ID \"cat-gifs\".\n\n## Analysis"
