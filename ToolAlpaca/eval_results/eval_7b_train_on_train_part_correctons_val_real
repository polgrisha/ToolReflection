The standard answer calls the function `AirportApi_getAirport` with the parameter `{\"icao_code\": \"EDDF\"}`, while the AI assistant calls the same function but with a different parameter `{\"icao_code\": \"FRA\"}`. This is a crucial difference because the ICAO code is a unique identifier for airports, and using the wrong code will not return the correct airport information.
