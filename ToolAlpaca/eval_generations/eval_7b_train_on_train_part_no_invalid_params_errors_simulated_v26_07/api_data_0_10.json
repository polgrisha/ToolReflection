Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive.

This API provides the following features: 1) User authentication and authorization through various identity providers (e.g. Google, Facebook, Twitter). 2) User management and user profile customization. 3) Role-based access control, which allows for granular control over who has access to what data or functionality within an application. 4) Passwordless authentication options such as biometric or multi-factor authentication. Overall, Auth0 is designed to simplify the process of adding secure and customizable authentication to your application without requiring extensive development experience.",

This API makes sure that addresses are validated, correct, and up-to-date, ensuring that mailings and packages get to the intended destination. The API features two main functions: 1) Verify US addresses to ensure they meet USPS standards and are deliverable, and 2) Standardize US addresses to create consistency and accuracy in addressing. With Lob.com's address verification API, companies can save time and money by eliminating potential errors in their address lists and ensuring that mailings reach their intended target.",
