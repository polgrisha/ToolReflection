Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive.

        "Introduction": "The Améthyste API is a powerful tool that allows developers to generate unique and customized images for Discord users. With this API, you can easily create images for avatars, banner backgrounds, and more. It offers a variety of functions, including: 1) Avatar generation, which allows you to create unique avatars that match the user's preferences. 2) Server icon generator, which helps you generate icons for Discord servers that resonate with the user's style. 3) Random image generator, which lets you generate custom images that match the user's taste. These functions are designed to be both efficient and easy to use, making it simple for developers to create dynamic, personalized images that engage their users.",

        "Introduction": "Auth0 is a comprehensive authentication and authorization platform that offers developers the ability to quickly and easily add authentication features to their applications. This API provides the following features: 1) User authentication and authorization through various identity providers (e.g. Google, Facebook, Twitter). 2) User management and user profile customization. 3) Role-based access control, which allows for granular control over who has access to what data or functionality within an application. 4) Passwordless authentication options such as biometric or multi-factor authentication. Overall, Auth0 is designed to simplify the process of adding secure and customizable authentication to your application without requiring extensive development experience.",
