Be sure your oven is at the correct temperature! Combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a mixing bowl. Add the olive oil and water and mix until combined. After the dough has come together, continue to knead for 5-6 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Let it rest for 10 minutes. 2 Make the sauce: In a large bowl, combine the tomatoes with salt, sugar, and chopped basil. Mix until well combined. Set aside. 3 Roll out the dough: After the dough has rested, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal halves. Spread a bit of flour over the dough to help with the rolling. Use your hands, rolling pin, or a combination of both to shape the dough. When you think you've gotten it to the desired size, carefully lift it onto a floured pizza peel. If you don’t want to use a pizza peel, you can also use a large cutting board or a rimless cookie sheet. 4 Add the toppings: Spoon sauce over the dough, spreading it out evenly. Add shredded mozzarella cheese over the top, followed by fresh torn basil. Transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven. Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. 5 Slice and serve: Remove the pizza from the oven with a large spatula or pizza peel.
